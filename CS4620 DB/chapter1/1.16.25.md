### Motivating questions

- What is a database? What is a DBMS?
    - Database: collection of related data
    - Data: known facts that can be recorded and have implicit meaning
    - Database Mangement System DBMS: Software package or system to facilitate the creation and mainteenence and of a computarized databse
    - Database system: The DBMS software together with the data itself. Sometimes, applications are also included.

### Simplified DB env

- See slides for reference diagram.
    - Metadata: i.e., the columns and rows in an excel spreadsheet.
    - Stored databse:
- See slides "example of a simple database" for reference
    - "creator of DB doesn't care about data", i.e., canvas doesn't care *what* BGSU puts in the database only the columns...


### Types of databases and database applications

- Traditional applications
    - numeric and textual
- More recent
    - multimedia,
    - geographic info
    - biological and genome
    - "data warehouses"
    - mobile databases
    - distributed DB systems
    - real-time and active DB

### Typical DBMS Functionality

- Define a particular database
    - In terms of its data types, structures, and constraints
- Manipulate data in the database
    - create, read, update and delete data ("CRUD")
- Processs and share by a set of concurrent users and application programs
    - Yet, keep all data valid and consistent
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Presentation \& Visualization of data


### Database users
#### Actors "on the scene"

- Database admins
- Database designers
- End users
    - casual users
    - naive users
    - sophisticated users
    - standalone users
- System analyssts and software engineers

#### Actors "behind the scene"

- System Designers and Implementers
    - Design and implements DBMS packages in the form of modules and interfaces
- Tool developers
    - Design and implement tools for modeling and designing databses, performance monitoring, prototyping, test data generation, etc.
- Operator s and maintence personnel

### Advantages of DBMS

- **Control data redundancy**
- Control authorization of access
- provide persistent storage
- providing optimizations for queries
- provide backup and recovery services
- represent complex relationships
- enforce integrity constraints
- draw inferences and actions from stored data, using deductive and active rules and triggers

- Potential for enforcing standards
    - Data item names, display formats, screens, report structures, web page layouts, etc
- Reducded application developement time
    - Incremental time to add each new application is reducded
- Flexibility to change data structures
    - Database structure may evolve as new requirements are defined.
- Availability of current information
    - Important for on-line transaction systems
- Economies of scale:
    - overlap of resources and personnel can be avoided


### When NOT to use a DBMS

- Main costs of using dbms is the overhead asscioated with it.
- Unncessary: If the application is simple, not expected to change and/or access by multiple users is not required
- infeasible: The DBMS is
