### Data Models, Schemas and Instances

#### Data Models

- "Use a data model to model data"...
- Describes the strucutre of a database and the operations for manipulating said structures. 
- Also describes constraints of the DB
    - Structure of Databse
        - Elements (w/ data type) and relationships
    - Operations
        - basic operations specify retrievals and updates on the DB
        - User-defined operations specify behaviors of objects
    - Constraints
        - Specify some restrictions on valid data
        - these constraints must always be enforced
        - Different data models naturally have different constraints.
            - For example, a relational datbase should have keys

##### Categories of Data Models
   
   - **conceptual (high level, semantic data models)** <- this is what we will be doing
        - Close to how users perceive data
   - Physical (low-level, internal) data models
        - details of how data is stored in the computer
   - Implementation (representational) data models
        - Represent data by using record strucutres
        - Provide concepts that fall between the above two
   - Self-Describing Data Models
        - Combine the descriptuion of data with data values
        - examples include XML, key-value stores and some NOSQL systems


#### Scehmas and Instances

- Database schema
    - Descriptino fo DB
        - includes criptions of data structures...
- Database state
- Initial Database State

#### Three Scehma Architecture

- (See slides for Diagram)
- External level, conceptual level, and internal level
- External view, Conceptual Schema, Internal Schema
- Our focus is on the conceptual schema. 
- "Views" will be covered later, and all us to represent what end users see.
    - You can save complex queries as views, for examples.
    - A professor and a student would have different views of a database for a university


### DBMS Languages and Interfaces

- Data Definition Language
    - i.e., SQL. 
    - Used to define data (`create table`). Defines the concpetual, internal and external schemas (views) of a database
- Database Manipulation Language
    - also SQL, for example
    - Used to specify database retrievals and updates
    - DML commands (data sublanguage) can be embedded in a general-purpose programming language ('host language')
    - Standalone DML commands can also be used

### DBMS Interfaces

- Stand-alone query langauge interfaces
    - SQL queries at SQL interface
- Programmer interfaces for emedding DML in a programming language
    - embedded SQL <- Typical approach
    - procedure call - JDBC for Java, ODBC for others
    - DBMS SQL-based programming language
- User friendly interfaces
    - Menu based, forms based, GUI< natural language, keywork-based search, speech I/O, etc.

### Database Utilities and Tools

- To perform certain functions such as:
    - Load data stored in files into a DB
    - Backup the database periodicially
    - Performance monitoring
    - Report generation
    - Other functions, sorting files, monitoring access by user, data compression, etc

### Centralized DBMS Architecture

- Combines everything into a single system
    - Includes DBMS software, hardware, aplication programs, and UI processing software
- User can connect through a remote terminal
    - All processing is done at a centralized site

### Client-Server Architecture

- Client through a client software module to access and utilize the various server resources
- Performance issues, security, etc
- All clients need to know where the DBMS server is.

### Three tier cliet-server architecture

1. GUI or Web Interface
2. Application server (Application, web page, etc)
3. Database Management System

### Classifications of DBMS

- Based on data models used
    - Legacy: network, hierarchical
    - Current: relational, object-oriented, object-relational
    - recent technologies: NOSQL (document based, column-based, graph-based and key-value based, Native XML)
- Other classifications:
    - Single-User vs. Multiuser
    - Centralized vs. distributed
    - General purpose vs. special purpose

### Cost considerations for DBMS

- Cost range
    - Free to millions of dollars
